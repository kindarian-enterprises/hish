- **Learning-Oriented**: Every solution contributes to future problem-solving
- **Quality-Driven**: Production-ready patterns validated across multiple projects

## **üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL PHILOSOPHY**

### **Universal Intelligence Principle**
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Solutions from one project inform solutions in others
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common architectural and implementation patterns
- **Anti-Pattern Avoidance**: Learn from failures across the entire ecosystem
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combine insights from multiple domains for optimal solutions

### **Context Discovery Principle**
- **Automatic Recognition**: No manual configuration needed for project boundaries
- **Intelligent Routing**: Direct queries to appropriate knowledge collections
- **Relationship Mapping**: Understand connections between projects and technologies
- **Adaptive Learning**: Evolve understanding based on new project contexts

### **Quality Evolution Principle**
- **Pattern Validation**: Solutions improve through cross-project application
- **Continuous Refinement**: Best practices evolve with new use cases
- **Knowledge Quality**: Maintain high standards for stored patterns and solutions
- **Anti-Pattern Documentation**: Prevent repeated mistakes across projects

## **üîß CODING STANDARDS & PRACTICES**

### **üö® CRITICAL EFFICIENCY PRINCIPLE**
**ALWAYS fix linting, formatting, and style issues when already editing a file.**
- **Why**: Prevents future technical debt and eliminates costly "cleanup" sessions
- **When**: Every time you touch a file - no exceptions
- **What**: Magic numbers ‚Üí constants, unused imports, type hints, formatting issues, deprecated patterns
- **Impact**: Maintains consistent code quality without dedicated cleanup time

### **üîç External Library Contract Verification**
Before integrating any third-party library or API:
1. **Read the official docs** ‚Äì confirm return types & error semantics
2. **Add a minimal test** that captures the contract
3. **Annotate with precise type hints**
4. **Guard against contract drift** ‚Äì use CI warnings when versions bump

### **Universal Code Quality Standards**
```python
# ‚úÖ ALWAYS use these patterns across all languages:
# Type hints throughout - use modern union syntax
def process_message(data: str | bytes | None) -> TaskResult:
    pass

# Use constants for magic numbers
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30

# Proper exception chaining
try:
    risky_operation()
except OriginalError as err:
    raise CustomError("Context") from err

# Clean error handling
with contextlib.suppress(FileNotFoundError):
    load_config_file()
```

### **Testing Philosophy (Universal)**
```python
# ‚úÖ Separate unit (mocked) from integration (real services)
# tests/unit/ - All mocked, fast execution
# tests/integration/ - Real services, comprehensive scenarios

# ‚úÖ Use underscore prefixes for unused parameters
def test_handler(_mock_transport, _unused_fixture):
    pass

# ‚úÖ Avoid real timing dependencies in tests
@patch('asyncio.sleep')
async def test_timing(mock_sleep):
    pass

# ‚úÖ ALWAYS define constants for magic numbers when editing files
EXPECTED_CALL_COUNT_TWICE = 2
HTTP_STATUS_CONFLICT = 409
TASK_PHASE_DELAY_SECONDS = 0.2
```

### **üö® CRITICAL COVERAGE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS**
```python
# üö® ALWAYS maintain proper test coverage separation
# üö® CONSTANTLY review and update which code is covered by integration tests vs unit tests
# üö® NEVER let integration-heavy code pollute unit test coverage calculations

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Integration-heavy code excluded from unit coverage
# Unit tests should exclude:
# - Real service interactions (HTTP, MQTT, Redis)
# - Transport layer real implementations
# - External API real operations
# - Database real operations

# ‚ùå WRONG: Integration code included in unit coverage
# This creates unrealistic coverage numbers and maintenance confusion
```

## **üö® CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERNS**

### **‚ùå Code Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
```python
# ‚ùå NEVER use deprecated patterns
result.meta  # Use result.info instead (Celery)

# ‚ùå NEVER hardcode configuration
url = "http://localhost:8008"  # Use environment variables

# ‚ùå NEVER bypass centralized error handling
direct_api_call()  # Use workflow_manager methods

# ‚ùå NEVER leave magic numbers in code during editing
time.sleep(0.2)  # Use TASK_PHASE_DELAY_SECONDS = 0.2
assert response.status_code == 409  # Use HTTP_STATUS_CONFLICT = 409

# ‚ùå NEVER ignore linting errors in files you're working on
assert result.count == 2  # noqa: PLR2004  # BAD: Fix with constant instead

# ‚ùå NEVER ignore style issues when already editing a file
from unused_module import something  # Remove unused imports immediately
```

### **‚ùå Architecture Anti-Patterns**
- **Never bypass authentication layers** - Always use proper token scoping
- **Never make direct service calls** - Use gateways or transport abstractions
- **Never skip retry/circuit breaker logic** - Use centralized error handling
- **Never hardcode service discovery** - Use environment-based configuration
- **Never ignore container boundaries** - Respect service isolation

### **‚ùå RAG-Enhanced Development Anti-Patterns**
```python
# ‚ùå NEVER start implementation without querying existing patterns
implement_new_feature()  # Query first: qdrant-find "similar feature implementations"

# ‚ùå NEVER ignore historical solutions to similar problems
debug_error_without_context()  # Query: qdrant-find "similar error patterns"

# ‚ùå NEVER forget to store successful solutions for future use
fix_implemented = True  # Store: qdrant-store "solution for [problem]"

# ‚ùå NEVER limit context to current repository when solution may exist elsewhere
search_only_current_repo()  # Query across all: qdrant-find "patterns across projects"

# ‚ùå NEVER assume pattern applicability without validation
copy_pattern_blindly()  # Validate: qdrant-find "when this pattern fails"
```

## **üõ†Ô∏è RAG-ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY**

### **üß† Knowledge Discovery First**
1. **Query Existing Patterns**: Use `qdrant-find` to discover relevant implementations before starting
2. **Learn from Code History**: Search actual implementations across all repositories
3. **Avoid Known Pitfalls**: Query documented anti-patterns and historical issues
4. **Pattern Storage**: Store new solutions with `qdrant-store` for future knowledge base enhancement
5. **Cross-Repository Context**: Access design decisions and implementations across the entire ecosystem

### **üîç RAG-Enhanced Problem-Solving Approach**
1. **Understand the System**: Query existing patterns with `qdrant-find` before reading code manually
2. **Discover Similar Issues**: Search historical solutions and anti-patterns across all projects
3. **Learn from Implementation**: Find actual working code examples across repositories
4. **Validate Against Known Patterns**: Check against documented approaches and architectural decisions
5. **Store New Insights**: Use `qdrant-store` to capture successful solutions for future retrieval
6. **Cross-Reference Solutions**: Link new implementations to existing patterns and established practices

### **Quality-First Development (RAG-Augmented)**
1. **Use Build Systems for Everything**: Never run tools directly (`make format`, `make lint`, `make test`)
2. **Query Before Implementing**: `qdrant-find "similar implementation patterns"` before coding
3. **Test Incrementally**: Unit tests first, then integration, then end-to-end
4. **Configuration-Driven**: Environment variables, not hardcoded values
5. **Container-Native**: Develop and test in containers, not local environments
6. **üö® ALWAYS Fix While Editing**: When touching any file, immediately fix ALL linting, formatting, and style issues in that file - saves massive time vs hunting fixes later
7. **üö® ALWAYS Define Constants**: When editing any file, replace ALL magic numbers with named constants - prevents technical debt accumulation
8. **üö® ALWAYS Maintain Test Coverage Separation**: Keep unit and integration test coverage properly separated for realistic metrics

### **Problem-Solving Approach**
1. **Understand the System**: Query existing patterns and abstractions first
2. **Isolate the Issue**: Test each service boundary independently
3. **Fix Root Causes**: Address underlying architecture, not just symptoms
4. **Validate Comprehensively**: Test the fix across all affected boundaries
5. **Document Patterns**: Update abstractions and examples for future use

### **Architecture Decision Making**
- **Bias toward Production Patterns**: Choose patterns that scale to enterprise use
- **Explicit over Implicit**: Clear interfaces, obvious behavior, comprehensive logging

## **üö® CRITICAL REPOSITORY BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT** üö®

### **MANDATORY FILE CREATION PROTOCOLS**
**BEFORE ANY FILE WRITE OPERATION:**
1. **ALWAYS verify current working directory**: `pwd`
2. **ALWAYS confirm repository context**: Check if you're in the correct project directory
3. **NEVER assume repository location from memory or conversation context**
4. **ALWAYS use relative paths within the target repository**

### **REPOSITORY SCOPE BOUNDARIES**
- **Framework Repository**: `kindarian-cursor-context/` - Context management and knowledge system
- **Project Repositories**: External code repositories indexed by RAG
- **Local Contexts**: `local/` directory (gitignored) for user-specific project contexts
- **Shared Contexts**: `contexts/` directory (tracked) for framework examples and patterns

### **FORBIDDEN CROSS-REPOSITORY OPERATIONS**
- ‚ùå Creating framework files in external project repositories
- ‚ùå Creating project files in the framework repository
- ‚ùå Using absolute paths when relative paths suffice
- ‚ùå Modifying files in one repository while working in another repository context

```

#### **Phase 3: Knowledge Capture & Storage**
```bash
# STEP 1: Store successful implementation patterns
qdrant-store "Authentication Solution: JWT with refresh tokens - Implemented secure token management with automatic refresh. Context: Web API authentication. Validates against: OWASP guidelines. Files: auth.py, middleware.py. Performance: 50ms avg response time."

# STEP 2: Store anti-patterns discovered
qdrant-store "Anti-pattern: Storing JWT secrets in code - Failed because secrets exposed in repository. Alternative: Environment variables with rotation. Context: Any JWT implementation. Prevention: Use secret management service."

# STEP 3: Store configuration insights
qdrant-store "Configuration: JWT expiration times - Access tokens: 15min, Refresh: 7 days. Context: Balance security vs UX. Dependencies: Redis for token blacklisting. Validated in: Production load testing."
```

### **üîç ERROR RESOLUTION WORKFLOW**

#### **Step 1: Historical Context Query**
```bash
# Query for similar error patterns
qdrant-find "authentication token validation errors"
qdrant-find "middleware configuration issues"
