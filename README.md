# 🧠 Kindarian Cursor Context

**A comprehensive scaffold and template system for creating knowledge-powered development agents with persistent context management and RAG integration.**

## 🎯 **What Is This?**

Kindarian Cursor Context provides everything you need to transform your Cursor AI assistant from a stateless helper into a persistent, knowledge-driven development partner that:

- **Remembers everything** across sessions with structured context management
- **Learns from your codebase** through semantic search and pattern recognition  
- **Builds institutional knowledge** by storing solutions and anti-patterns
- **Follows consistent practices** through customizable persona definitions
- **Maintains project continuity** with rigorous update protocols

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **1. Copy Templates to Your Project**
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone [repository-url] kindarian-cursor-context
cd kindarian-cursor-context

# Copy templates to your project
cp templates/persona/dev_agent_persona_template.md your-project/dev_agent_persona.md
cp templates/context/dev_agent_context_template.md your-project/dev_agent_context.md
cp templates/prompts/dev_agent_init_prompt_template.md your-project/dev_agent_init_prompt.md
cp templates/prompts/dev_agent_session_end_prompt_template.md your-project/dev_agent_session_end_prompt.md
```

### **2. Customize for Your Project**
```bash
# Edit the persona to match your tech stack and standards
vim your-project/dev_agent_persona.md

# Set up your project context and current status
vim your-project/dev_agent_context.md

# Customize initialization requirements
vim your-project/dev_agent_init_prompt.md
```

### **3. Set Up RAG Knowledge System (Optional)**
```bash
# Copy RAG infrastructure
cp -r rag your-project/
cp -r mcp your-project/
cp compose.rag.yml your-project/

# Start the knowledge system
cd your-project
docker-compose -f compose.rag.yml up -d

# Index your codebase
cd rag/indexer
python app.py index /path/to/your/code --collection your_project_code
```

## 🎭 **Agent Persona System**

The persona template lets you define:

- **Agent Identity**: Role, expertise areas, technology focus
- **Coding Standards**: Language-specific patterns, quality requirements
- **Architectural Philosophy**: Design principles, decision-making frameworks
- **Anti-Patterns**: What to avoid and why
- **RAG Integration**: Knowledge discovery and storage workflows

### **Example Persona Customization**
```markdown
## AGENT IDENTITY & ROLE
You are **MyProject Dev Agent** - a senior full-stack engineer with expertise in:
- **React/TypeScript Frontend** (Next.js, TailwindCSS, React Query)
- **Node.js Backend** (Express, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- **Cloud Infrastructure** (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes)
- **Production-Grade Development** (CI/CD, monitoring, security)

## ARCHITECTURAL PHILOSOPHY
### Reliability-First Design
- **Fault Tolerance**: Design for failure scenarios
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Security by Design**: Zero-trust architecture principles
```

## 📊 **Context Management System**

The context template provides structured tracking of:

- **Project Phases**: Current status, goals, deliverables
- **Component Status**: Architecture, implementation state
- **Achievements**: Historical accomplishments with timestamps
- **Issues**: Current blockers, technical debt, priorities
- **Lessons Learned**: Anti-patterns, successful solutions

### **Update Protocol Enforcement**
- **Verified Timestamps**: No hallucinated dates allowed
- **Append-Only**: Preserve all historical information
- **Structured Format**: Consistent syntax for machine processing
- **Change Tracking**: Every modification requires rationale

## 🧠 **Knowledge-Driven Development**

### **RAG-Enhanced Workflow**
```bash
# Before implementing: Query existing patterns
qdrant-find "authentication implementation patterns"
qdrant-find "error handling approaches for APIs"

# After solving: Store new knowledge
qdrant-store "Solution: JWT refresh token rotation - Implemented secure token management with Redis blacklist. Context: Web API authentication. Performance: <50ms response time."
```

### **Cross-Project Learning**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful approaches across codebases
- **Anti-Pattern Avoidance**: Learn from historical mistakes
- **Decision Context**: Understand why previous choices were made
- **Performance Insights**: Apply optimization patterns that work

## 🛠️ **Setup Workflows**

### **For New Projects**
1. Copy and customize templates
2. Set up RAG infrastructure (optional)
3. Index existing codebase and documentation
4. Train team on knowledge query patterns
5. Establish context update protocols

### **For Existing Projects**
1. Create persona based on current practices
2. Document current state in context template
3. Gradually build knowledge base from tribal knowledge
