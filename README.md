# üß† Kindarian Cursor Context

**A comprehensive framework for managing multiple development agents with shared knowledge and cross-project intelligence.**

## üéØ **What Is This?**

Kindarian Cursor Context is a multi-project development agent framework that transforms your entire engineering ecosystem into a knowledge-powered learning machine:

- **Multi-Project Intelligence**: One framework manages contexts for all your projects
- **Shared Knowledge Base**: Patterns discovered in one project benefit ALL projects
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Agents learn from your entire codebase ecosystem
- **Centralized Context Management**: All project contexts, personas, and knowledge in one place
- **Institutional Memory**: Persistent learning across teams, projects, and time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Discover solutions from any project when working on any other project

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **1. Set Up the Framework**
```bash
# Clone the framework (your permanent context management hub)
git clone [repository-url] kindarian-cursor-context
cd kindarian-cursor-context

# Start the shared knowledge system
make quick-start

# This will:
# - Start Qdrant vector database
# - Build the MCP server
# - Show you the next steps
```

### **2. Create Your First Project Context**
```bash
# Create a new project context
./scripts/new-project-context.sh

# This creates: contexts/your-project-name/
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev_agent_persona.md      # Project-specific agent configuration
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev_agent_context.md      # Project state and history
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev_agent_init_prompt.md  # Initialization protocol
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project_config.yml        # Code repo paths and settings
```

### **3. Index Your Code Repositories**
```bash
# Index your project's code (stored separately from context)
cd rag/indexer
python app.py index /path/to/your-project-code --collection your_project_code
python app.py index /path/to/another-project --collection another_project_code

# All projects share the same knowledge base for cross-project insights!
```

### **4. Configure Cursor MCP Integration**
```bash
# Get the exact configuration for your system
make setup-cursor

# This shows you the JSON to add to Cursor settings.json
# Or follow the detailed guide: docs/setup/cursor-mcp-integration.md
```

**Quick MCP Setup**: Add this to your Cursor `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "kindarian-qdrant": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "compose", "-f", "/absolute/path/to/kindarian-cursor-context/compose.rag.yml", 
          "run", "--rm", "-i", "mcp-qdrant-stdio"
        ],
        "env": {
          "QDRANT_URL": "http://localhost:6333",
          "COLLECTION_NAME": "default"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Replace `/absolute/path/to/kindarian-cursor-context/` with your actual path!**

### **5. Initialize Your Agent**
In Cursor, open the kindarian-cursor-context framework and reference your project:
```
@contexts/your-project-name/dev_agent_init_prompt.md
```

**‚úÖ You should now have access to these tools in Cursor:**
- `qdrant-find "search query"` - Search patterns across all your projects
- `qdrant-store "solution description"` - Store new solutions for the ecosystem

**üß™ Test your setup by directing the agent:**
```
Research authentication patterns across our projects and propose an approach for this context that leverages our proven solutions.
```

The agent will automatically:
- Query knowledge base with `qdrant-find`
- Analyze patterns across projects
- Propose solutions combining best practices
- Store new solutions with `qdrant-store`

## üîÑ **Quick Start (Upstream + Main)**

We use a simple Git flow:

- `upstream` remote ‚Üí canonical repo (read-only for most users).
- You work on `main` (or feature branches) in your fork/clone.
- Local overrides live in ignored folders (see `.gitignore`).

### **First-time setup**
```bash
git remote -v
# If you don't see an 'upstream', add it (replace with canonical URL):
git remote add upstream <CANONICAL_REPO_URL>

# Ensure you're on main (or your working branch)
git checkout main
```

### **Pull updates from upstream**

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
# resolve conflicts if any, commit
```

### **Keep local overrides separate**

* Put machine/user-specific files into the ignored paths (see `.gitignore`).
* This keeps upstream pulls clean and avoids merge conflicts.

See `docs/branching.md` and `docs/data-management.md` for details.

## üé≠ **Agent Persona System**

**No configuration files needed** - agents intelligently discover context and relationships from directory structure and content.

The persona template lets you define:

- **Agent Identity**: Role, expertise areas, technology focus
- **Coding Standards**: Language-specific patterns, quality requirements
- **Architectural Philosophy**: Design principles, decision-making frameworks
- **Anti-Patterns**: What to avoid and why
- **RAG Integration**: Knowledge discovery and storage workflows

### **Example Persona Customization**
```markdown
## AGENT IDENTITY & ROLE
You are **MyProject Dev Agent** - a senior full-stack engineer with expertise in:
- **React/TypeScript Frontend** (Next.js, TailwindCSS, React Query)
- **Node.js Backend** (Express, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- **Cloud Infrastructure** (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes)
- **Production-Grade Development** (CI/CD, monitoring, security)

## ARCHITECTURAL PHILOSOPHY
### Reliability-First Design
- **Fault Tolerance**: Design for failure scenarios
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Security by Design**: Zero-trust architecture principles
```

## üìä **Context Management System**

The context template provides structured tracking of:

- **Project Phases**: Current status, goals, deliverables
- **Component Status**: Architecture, implementation state
- **Achievements**: Historical accomplishments with timestamps
- **Issues**: Current blockers, technical debt, priorities
- **Lessons Learned**: Anti-patterns, successful solutions

### **Update Protocol Enforcement**
- **Verified Timestamps**: No hallucinated dates allowed
- **Append-Only**: Preserve all historical information
- **Structured Format**: Consistent syntax for machine processing
- **Change Tracking**: Every modification requires rationale

## üß† **Knowledge-Driven Development**

### **RAG-Enhanced Workflow**
```bash
# Before implementing: Query existing patterns
qdrant-find "authentication implementation patterns"
qdrant-find "error handling approaches for APIs"

# After solving: Store new knowledge
qdrant-store "Solution: JWT refresh token rotation - Implemented secure token management with Redis blacklist. Context: Web API authentication. Performance: <50ms response time."
```

### **Cross-Project Learning**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful approaches across codebases
- **Anti-Pattern Avoidance**: Learn from historical mistakes
- **Decision Context**: Understand why previous choices were made
- **Performance Insights**: Apply optimization patterns that work

## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup Workflows**

### **For New Projects**
1. Copy and customize templates
2. Set up RAG infrastructure (optional)
3. Index existing codebase and documentation
4. Train team on knowledge query patterns
5. Establish context update protocols

### **For Existing Projects**
1. Create persona based on current practices
2. Document current state in context template

## üåü **Cross-Project Intelligence in Action**

### **Real Example: Authentication Solution Discovery**
```bash
# üéØ Scenario: You're building a new mobile app and need authentication

# 1. Query across ALL your projects for auth patterns
qdrant-find "JWT refresh token implementations"

# 2. Framework finds solutions from:
# - Web App: React useAuth hook with automatic refresh
# - API Service: Go middleware with Redis token blacklist  
# - Previous Mobile: React Native secure storage patterns
# - Shared: OAuth2 server configuration

# 3. You adapt the best patterns for your new context
qdrant-store "Mobile Auth Solution: Combined web useAuth pattern with RN secure storage - Automatic token refresh, biometric fallback, offline support. Context: React Native apps. Performance: <200ms auth check. Files: hooks/useAuth.ts, utils/secureStorage.ts"

# 4. Your solution becomes available to ALL future projects!
```

### **Example: Performance Pattern Cross-Pollination**
```bash
# API team discovers caching strategy
qdrant-store "Redis Caching Layer: 80% latency reduction with write-through cache - Cache user sessions, API responses, computed values. Context: High-traffic APIs. Implementation: Redis cluster with TTL."

# Mobile team later queries for performance
qdrant-find "caching strategies for better performance"
# Discovers the API caching pattern and adapts it for mobile local storage

# Web team benefits too
qdrant-find "user session optimization patterns"  
# Finds both API Redis patterns and mobile storage patterns
```
