# ðŸ”„ Agent Management Workflows

This guide provides standard workflows for common agent management scenarios in the Kindarian Cursor Context framework.

## ðŸš€ **Project Initiation Workflows**

### **Starting a New Project with Agent**

**1. Context Preparation**
```bash
# Create project context
make new-context

# Configure project context
# Edit contexts/project-name/dev_agent_persona.md
# Edit contexts/project-name/project_config.yml
```

**2. Agent Initialization**
```
@contexts/project-name/dev_agent_init_prompt.md

We're starting a new [project type] project. Research our existing patterns for [technology stack] across all projects and propose an initial architecture that leverages our proven approaches.
```

**3. Knowledge Foundation**
```
Before implementing anything, research these areas across our ecosystem:
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Testing strategies for [technology]
- Deployment and CI/CD approaches
- Error handling and logging patterns
- Performance optimization techniques

Create an initial architectural proposal that incorporates our best practices.
```

**4. Index Project Code (when code exists)**
```bash
make index-repo REPO_PATH=/path/to/project COLLECTION_NAME=project_name_code
```

### **Onboarding Agent to Existing Project**

**1. Context Loading**
```
@contexts/existing-project/dev_agent_init_prompt.md

This is an existing project. Research the current codebase patterns and our historical approaches to similar projects. Familiarize yourself with our established practices for this technology stack.
```

**2. Current State Analysis**
```
Analyze the current state of this project:
- Review the codebase for existing patterns and approaches
- Identify areas that could benefit from patterns used in our other projects
- Look for opportunities to apply cross-project optimizations
- Note any anti-patterns that should be addressed
```

**3. Improvement Recommendations**
```
Based on your analysis and our ecosystem patterns, propose specific improvements that would:
- Apply successful patterns from other projects
- Address technical debt using proven approaches
- Enhance quality using our established standards
- Improve performance using techniques from similar projects
```

## ðŸ”§ **Development Workflow Management**

### **Feature Development Workflow**

**1. Research Phase**
```
We need to implement [feature description]. Research how we've built similar features across our projects and propose an approach that:
- Leverages our proven patterns
- Considers cross-project compatibility
- Follows our established quality standards
- Can be reused in future projects
```

**2. Implementation Guidance**
```
Implement [feature] following these guidelines:
- Apply the research patterns you discovered
- Maintain consistency with our established approaches
- Document any new patterns that emerge
- Store solutions that could benefit other projects
```

**3. Knowledge Capture**
```
After implementing [feature], ensure you:
- Store the solution pattern for future use
- Document any new workflows that emerged
- Create documentation if this represents a reusable approach
- Update any existing patterns that were improved
```

### **Debugging and Problem-Solving Workflow**

**1. Problem Analysis**
```
We're experiencing [problem description]. Research how we've solved similar issues across our projects and propose a debugging strategy that applies our proven diagnostic approaches.
```

**2. Solution Research**
```
Based on the problem analysis, research solutions that:
- Apply debugging patterns from similar issues
- Use our established diagnostic tools and techniques
- Consider solutions that worked in other project contexts
- Avoid approaches that have failed in our ecosystem
```

**3. Resolution Documentation**
```
After resolving the issue:
- Document the debugging process if it was novel or complex
- Store the solution pattern for similar future issues
- Create workflow documentation if the process should be standardized
- Update any existing troubleshooting guides
```

## ðŸ“š **Documentation Creation Workflows**

### **Workflow Documentation Creation**

**When to trigger:**
- Agent solves same type of problem multiple times
- Complex process emerges that should be standardized
- Team needs to replicate successful approaches

**Instructions to agent:**
```
You've now [accomplished task] in multiple contexts. Create a standardized workflow document that captures this methodology so we can:
- Apply it consistently across projects
- Train other agents on this approach
- Avoid reinventing solutions to similar problems
- Build on this foundation for related challenges

Include:
- Decision trees for when to apply this approach
- Step-by-step process documentation
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Examples from the implementations you've completed
```

### **Architectural Decision Documentation**

**When to trigger:**
- Major technology or design choices are made
- Trade-offs between approaches are evaluated
- Patterns emerge that should be standardized

**Instructions to agent:**
```
Document this architectural decision as a formal ADR (Architecture Decision Record). Include:
- Problem context and requirements
- Alternatives that were considered
- Decision rationale and trade-offs
- Implementation guidelines and examples
- Success criteria and monitoring approaches

Store this so future similar decisions can reference this analysis.
```

### **Anti-Pattern Documentation**

**When to trigger:**
- Approaches fail or cause significant problems
- Debugging reveals systemic design issues
- Performance problems are traced to specific patterns

**Instructions to agent:**
```
This [problem/approach] represents an anti-pattern that should be documented to prevent future occurrences. Create documentation that includes:
- Clear description of the anti-pattern
- Why it fails and what problems it causes
- How to recognize the symptoms
- Correct approaches and alternatives
- Examples of proper implementation

Make this discoverable so future similar situations can avoid this pitfall.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Quality Management Workflows**

### **Code Quality Review Workflow**

**1. Quality Assessment**
```
