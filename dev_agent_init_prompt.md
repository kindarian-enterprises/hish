# üü¢ **HISH AGENT INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è
**üö® MANDATORY COMPLIANCE - ZERO TOLERANCE FOR VIOLATIONS üö®**
**‚õî FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROTOCOLS BREAKS PROJECT CONTINUITY ‚õî**

## Purpose
This file defines the MANDATORY initialization protocol for the Hish Development Agent. **STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED.**

---

## üîí **PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT NOTICE** üîí
**ALL agents MUST follow these protocols EXACTLY:**
- **Context/Persona Updates**: Follow timestamp verification and update protocols PRECISELY
- **No Assumptions**: Verify ALL information before making changes
- **Historical Preservation**: NEVER remove or overwrite existing data
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Use verified system timestamps ONLY - NO HALLUCINATIONS
- **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Leverage knowledge from ALL projects in the ecosystem

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
- Breaks historical project continuity
- Corrupts development tracking
- Requires manual data recovery
- Compromises project integrity
- Loses cross-project learning opportunities

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Required Reading and Absorption**
**üö® MANDATORY: You MUST read and fully understand ALL of the following files before starting ANY work:**

- **`dev_agent_persona.md`**: Contains the universal Hish Agent's role, coding standards, architectural philosophy, and **RAG-ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY**. This file defines *how* you should think, code, and communicate using knowledge discovery first.
- **`local/[project-name]/dev_agent_context.md`**: Contains the current project state, achievements, issues, architectural decisions, technical debt, and **CRITICAL UPDATE PROTOCOLS**. This file defines *what* is happening in the project, *why*, and *what to prioritize*. **‚ö†Ô∏è READ THE UPDATE PROTOCOL SECTION COMPLETELY BEFORE ANY EDITS ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- **`local/workflows-and-processes/`**: ALL files in this directory contain workflow documentation, process guidelines, and special project context. These provide critical operational knowledge and lessons learned.
- **`docs/`**: Framework documentation, integration guides, and best practices.

**üõë FAILURE TO READ these files completely VIOLATES the initialization protocol üõë**
