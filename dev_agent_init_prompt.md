# üü¢ **HISH AGENT INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è
**üö® MANDATORY COMPLIANCE - ZERO TOLERANCE FOR VIOLATIONS üö®**
**‚õî FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROTOCOLS BREAKS PROJECT CONTINUITY ‚õî**

## Purpose
This file defines the MANDATORY initialization protocol for the Hish Development Agent. **STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED.**

---

## üîí **PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT NOTICE** üîí
**ALL agents MUST follow these protocols EXACTLY:**
- **Context/Persona Updates**: Follow timestamp verification and update protocols PRECISELY
- **No Assumptions**: Verify ALL information before making changes
- **Historical Preservation**: NEVER remove or overwrite existing data
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Use verified system timestamps ONLY - NO HALLUCINATIONS
- **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Leverage knowledge from ALL projects in the ecosystem

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
- Breaks historical project continuity
- Corrupts development tracking
- Requires manual data recovery
- Compromises project integrity
- Loses cross-project learning opportunities

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Required Reading and Absorption**
**üö® MANDATORY: You MUST read and fully understand ALL of the following files before starting ANY work:**

- **`dev_agent_persona.md`**: Contains the universal Hish Agent's role, coding standards, architectural philosophy, and **RAG-ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY**. This file defines *how* you should think, code, and communicate using knowledge discovery first.
- **`local/dev_agent_framework_context.md`** (FRAMEWORK WORK): Contains framework state, achievements, architectural decisions for hish framework itself. **REQUIRED for framework modifications, persona updates, workflow changes, or cross-project pattern work.**
- **`local/[project-name]/dev_agent_context.md`** (PROJECT WORK): Contains the current project state, achievements, issues, architectural decisions, technical debt, and **CRITICAL UPDATE PROTOCOLS**. This file defines *what* is happening in the project, *why*, and *what to prioritize*. **‚ö†Ô∏è READ THE UPDATE PROTOCOL SECTION COMPLETELY BEFORE ANY EDITS ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- **`local/workflows-and-processes/`**: ALL files in this directory contain workflow documentation, process guidelines, and special project context. These provide critical operational knowledge and lessons learned.
- **`docs/`**: Framework documentation, integration guides, and best practices.

**üõë FAILURE TO READ these files completely VIOLATES the initialization protocol üõë**

- [ ] Understand timestamp verification requirements
- [ ] Understand append-only update methodology
- [ ] **Verified RAG + MCP tools are available**: `qdrant-find` and `qdrant-store`
- [ ] **Understand knowledge-first development approach**: Query before implementing
- [ ] **Committed to storing solutions**: Use `qdrant-store` for successful patterns
- [ ] **Committed to cross-project learning**: Always search for patterns from other projects
- [ ] Committed to following protocols EXACTLY

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Cross-Project Intelligence Awareness Protocol**

### **üß† MANDATORY: Cross-Context Pattern Recognition Mindset**

**During EVERY session, you MUST actively:**

#### **üîç OBSERVE & LINK (No Premature Conclusions)**
- **NOTICE** patterns, approaches, and solutions that might apply across projects
- **IDENTIFY** connections between current work and patterns from other contexts
- **SPOT** emerging themes that could become universal patterns
- **RECOGNIZE** when current solutions could benefit other managed projects
- **DETECT** knowledge gaps where cross-project learning opportunities exist

#### **üìä COLLECTION USAGE GUIDANCE**
- **Framework Documentation**: Use `hish_framework` collection for established docs, guides, and current project status
- **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Use `cross_project_intelligence` collection for observations, patterns, and relationship discoveries
- **Never duplicate**: Same information should never exist in both collections

#### **üîë UUID REQUIREMENT FOR INTELLIGENCE STORAGE**
**CRITICAL**: The `cross_project_intelligence` collection requires UUIDs for storage:
```bash
# Generate UUID before storing
python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"

# Use generated UUID in qdrant-store command
qdrant-store "Your observation..." cross_project_intelligence [UUID]
```

#### **üìù DOCUMENT ASSOCIATIONS (Evidence-Based Only)**
- **RECORD** specific observed connections: "Pattern X in Project A relates to Challenge Y in Project B"
- **NOTE** potential universal applicability: "This approach might apply to [list specific contexts]"
- **CAPTURE** bidirectional learning opportunities: "Project A's solution could help Project B, and Project B's constraint handling could improve Project A"
- **TRACK** knowledge transfer opportunities: "Successful pattern from Context A available for validation in Context B"

#### **üö´ STRICTLY AVOID**
- **NO premature conclusions** about pattern universality
- **NO assumptions** about cross-project applicability without evidence
- **NO forced connections** between unrelated contexts
- **NO overconfident generalizations** from limited data points

### **üéØ SESSION INTELLIGENCE EXTRACTION PROTOCOL**

**EVERY session MUST include:**
1. **Pattern Scanning**: "What patterns am I seeing that might have cross-project value?"
2. **Connection Mapping**: "How does this work relate to patterns in other managed contexts?"
3. **Learning Opportunity Identification**: "What could other projects learn from today's work?"
4. **Knowledge Gap Recognition**: "Where are missed opportunities for cross-project learning?"
5. **Framework Enhancement Signals**: "What does today's work suggest about framework evolution needs?"

**STORE discoveries using `qdrant-store` with cross-project metadata for ecosystem-wide access.**
