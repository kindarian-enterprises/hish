# **HISH RED TEAM AGENT TROUBLESHOOTING**

## **Common Analysis Issues**

### **False Positive Findings**
**Challenge**: Analysis identifies issues that aren't actually vulnerabilities
**Indicators**: 
- Findings that don't reproduce in testing
- Issues that are by design or intentional
- Misunderstanding of security controls

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Verify findings with additional testing
1. Reproduce the issue in isolation
2. Check if it's a known false positive pattern
3. Validate against security best practices
4. Test with different inputs and conditions
5. Review code context and documentation
```

### **Missing Critical Vulnerabilities**
**Challenge**: Analysis fails to identify important security issues
**Indicators**:
- No critical findings in complex codebase
- Missing obvious security vulnerabilities
- Incomplete analysis coverage

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Enhance analysis methodology
1. Review analysis scope and depth
2. Use additional analysis tools
3. Check for common vulnerability patterns
4. Validate against OWASP Top 10
5. Perform manual code review
```

### **Insufficient Evidence**
**Problem**: Findings lack reproducible evidence
**Symptoms**:
- Vague descriptions without specific steps
- Findings that can't be reproduced
- Missing code references or examples

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Improve evidence gathering
1. Document specific steps to reproduce
2. Include code snippets and line numbers
3. Test findings in isolation
4. Capture screenshots or logs
5. Validate with different environments
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Enhance performance analysis
1. Use realistic test data
2. Test under load conditions
3. Monitor system resources
4. Use multiple analysis tools
5. Test with production-like environment
```

### **Container Security Scanning Issues**
**Problem**: Container scans fail or miss vulnerabilities
**Symptoms**:
- Scan failures or errors
- Missing known vulnerabilities
- Incomplete scan results

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Fix container scanning
1. Update scanning tools
2. Check image accessibility
3. Verify scan configuration
4. Use multiple scanning tools
5. Check for tool-specific issues
```

## üìä **Report Generation Issues**

### **Inconsistent Severity Assessment**
**Problem**: Severity levels don't match actual impact
**Symptoms**:
- Critical issues marked as low severity
- Low impact issues marked as critical
- Inconsistent severity across similar issues

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Standardize severity assessment
1. Use consistent severity criteria
2. Document impact assessment methodology
3. Review findings with team
4. Validate against business impact
5. Update severity guidelines
```

### **Missing Remediation Steps**
**Problem**: Findings lack specific fix recommendations
**Symptoms**:
- Vague remediation descriptions
- Missing implementation steps
- No code examples or references

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Improve remediation guidance
1. Provide specific implementation steps
2. Include code examples
3. Reference security best practices
4. Test remediation steps
5. Document expected outcomes
```

### **Cross-Project Pattern Recognition Issues**
**Problem**: Fails to identify patterns across projects
**Symptoms**:
- Similar issues in different projects
- Missing cross-project recommendations
- Inconsistent analysis across projects

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Enhance pattern recognition
1. Review findings across all projects
2. Look for recurring patterns
3. Document common issues
4. Create pattern database
5. Share findings between projects
```

## üîç **Analysis Methodology Issues**

### **Incomplete Analysis Coverage**
**Problem**: Analysis misses important areas
**Symptoms**:
- No findings in critical components
- Missing security controls testing
- Incomplete performance analysis

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Improve analysis coverage
1. Review analysis scope
2. Check all components and layers
3. Use systematic analysis approach
4. Validate against checklists
5. Get peer review of analysis
```

### **Insufficient Testing Depth**
**Problem**: Analysis is too superficial
**Symptoms**:
- Only surface-level findings
- Missing edge cases and error conditions
- No stress testing or load analysis

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Increase analysis depth
1. Test edge cases and error conditions
2. Perform stress and load testing
3. Test with malicious inputs
4. Validate error handling
5. Test recovery procedures
```

### **Missing Business Context**
**Problem**: Analysis doesn't consider business impact
**Symptoms**:
- Technical findings without business context
- Missing risk assessment
- No prioritization by business impact

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Add business context
1. Understand business requirements
2. Assess business impact of findings
3. Prioritize by business risk
4. Include business stakeholders
5. Document business implications
```
