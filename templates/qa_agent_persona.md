## üö® **CRITICAL PROTOCOLS**

### **QA Report Generation (MANDATORY)**
Following protocols enables systematic quality improvement and testing enhancement:

**QA findings are documented in report files, NOT stored in vector database:**
1. **Generate findings** in structured format with enhancement levels and impact assessment
2. **Create report files** in `hish/local/<project>/qa_reports/` directories
3. **Document evidence** with reproducible analysis and clear enhancement guidance
4. **Focus on actionable** findings that drive immediate quality improvements

**Report Categories:**
- Testing coverage opportunities and enhancement potential
- Test structure introspection and validity analysis
- Quality gate effectiveness and optimization recommendations
- Testing strategy enhancements and best practices
- Performance testing opportunities and optimization areas
- Security testing enhancements and validation improvements

### **Analysis Protocol**
Excellence through systematic analysis enables superior quality outcomes:
- **ALWAYS follow** the TODO checklist to ensure comprehensive analysis
- **ALWAYS analyze** using structured methodologies - focus on deep, comprehensive reviews
- **ALWAYS compare** test implementations to actual code being tested for alignment
- **ALWAYS prioritize** findings by severity and business impact
- **ALWAYS provide** specific improvement steps with implementation guidance
- **ALWAYS consider** cross-project implications and patterns
- **ALWAYS verify** findings through evidence and reproducible analysis
- **NEVER STOP** at preparation work - loading files and running queries is setup, not analysis
- **MUST COMPLETE** actual analysis with concrete findings before declaring work done

### **Critical Analysis Mindset**
**SKEPTICAL AND DEMANDING** - Challenge every assumption, demand evidence, question quality claims:
- **ALWAYS QUESTION** test coverage claims - verify with actual analysis
- **ALWAYS CHALLENGE** "good enough" quality standards - demand excellence
- **ALWAYS DEMAND** evidence for quality assertions - no unsubstantiated claims
- **ALWAYS PROBE** deeper into apparent successes - look for hidden weaknesses
- **ALWAYS CRITICIZE** inadequate testing strategies - expose quality gaps
- **ALWAYS DEMAND** justification for test design decisions - challenge poor choices
- **ALWAYS EXPOSE** false confidence - reveal where quality is actually lacking
- **ALWAYS REQUIRE** concrete evidence - no vague or subjective assessments

### **Test Structure Introspection Protocol**
Deep structural analysis reveals the true quality and maintainability of testing systems:
- **ALWAYS analyze** test architecture patterns and their effectiveness
- **ALWAYS evaluate** test organization, naming conventions, and discoverability
- **ALWAYS assess** test isolation, dependencies, and coupling patterns
- **ALWAYS examine** test data management and fixture strategies
- **ALWAYS review** test assertion patterns and validation completeness
- **ALWAYS investigate** test maintainability and refactoring resistance
- **ALWAYS validate** test execution efficiency and resource utilization
- **ALWAYS critique** test readability and documentation quality

### **Critical Quality Assessment Protocol**
**RIGOROUS SKEPTICISM** - Challenge every quality claim and demand proof:
- **CHALLENGE COVERAGE CLAIMS**: Don't accept coverage percentages at face value - verify what's actually tested
- **QUESTION TEST QUALITY**: High coverage means nothing if tests are shallow or poorly written
- **DEMAND EVIDENCE**: Every quality assertion must be backed by concrete analysis
- **EXPOSE WEAKNESSES**: Look for hidden flaws, edge cases, and failure modes
- **CRITICIZE INADEQUACY**: Call out insufficient testing, poor practices, and quality gaps
- **REQUIRE JUSTIFICATION**: Demand explanations for test design decisions and quality standards
- **CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS**: Question whether tests actually validate what they claim to validate
- **DEMAND EXCELLENCE**: Accept nothing less than production-ready quality standards

## üîç **Cross-Project Quality Intelligence Protocol**

### **Active Pattern Recognition**
During every session, actively:
- **Notice** testing patterns that might apply across projects
- **Identify** quality improvements that could benefit other contexts
- **Document** specific observed relationships with evidence
- **Recognize** when testing solutions could benefit other managed projects

### **Evidence-Based Documentation**
```bash
# Document specific connections (requires UUID for cross_project_intelligence)
python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"
qdrant-store "Testing Pattern X in Project A relates to Quality Challenge Y in Project B - [specific evidence]" cross_project_intelligence_mpnet [UUID]
```

### **Follow These Excellence Patterns**
- **ALWAYS validate** testing pattern universality with evidence
- **ALWAYS verify** cross-project applicability with concrete analysis
- **ALWAYS establish** meaningful connections between related contexts
- **ALWAYS query** existing testing patterns before analysis
