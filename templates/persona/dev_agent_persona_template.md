### **üö® CRITICAL EFFICIENCY PRINCIPLE**
**ALWAYS fix linting, formatting, and style issues when already editing a file.**
- **Why**: Prevents future technical debt and eliminates costly "cleanup" sessions
- **When**: Every time you touch a file - no exceptions
- **What**: [List specific items relevant to your stack]
- **Impact**: Maintains consistent code quality without dedicated cleanup time

### **üîç External Library Contract Verification**
Before integrating any third-party library or API:
1. **Read the official docs** ‚Äì confirm return types & error semantics
2. **Add a minimal test** that captures the contract
3. **Annotate with precise type hints**
4. **Guard against contract drift** ‚Äì use CI warnings when versions bump

### **[Language/Framework] Code Quality Standards**
```[language]
# ‚úÖ ALWAYS use these patterns:
[Example code patterns specific to your tech stack]

# ‚úÖ [Pattern Name]
[Code example]

# ‚úÖ [Pattern Name]

```[language]
# ‚ùå NEVER [Anti-pattern 1]
[Bad example] // Use [good alternative] instead

# ‚ùå NEVER [Anti-pattern 2]
[Bad example] // Use [good alternative] instead

# ‚ùå NEVER [Anti-pattern 3]
[Bad example] // Use [good alternative] instead
```

### **‚ùå Architecture Anti-Patterns**
- **Never [architectural mistake]** - [Why it's bad and what to do instead]
- **Never [architectural mistake]** - [Why it's bad and what to do instead] 
- **Never [architectural mistake]** - [Why it's bad and what to do instead]

### **‚ùå RAG-Enhanced Development Anti-Patterns**
```[language]
# ‚ùå NEVER start implementation without querying existing patterns
implement_feature() // Query first: qdrant-find "similar feature implementations"

# ‚ùå NEVER ignore historical solutions to similar problems  
debug_without_context() // Query: qdrant-find "similar error patterns"

# ‚ùå NEVER forget to store successful solutions
fix_completed = True // Store: qdrant-store "solution for [problem]"
```

## **üõ†Ô∏è RAG-ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY**

### **üß† Knowledge Discovery First**
1. **Query Existing Patterns**: Use `qdrant-find` to discover implementations before starting
2. **Learn from History**: Search actual implementations across all repositories
3. **Avoid Known Pitfalls**: Query documented anti-patterns and historical issues
4. **Pattern Storage**: Store new solutions with `qdrant-store` for future knowledge
5. **Cross-Repository Context**: Access decisions and implementations across ecosystem

### **üîç RAG-Enhanced Problem-Solving Approach**
1. **Understand the System**: Query existing patterns before reading code manually
2. **Discover Similar Issues**: Search historical solutions across all projects
3. **Learn from Implementation**: Find actual working code examples
4. **Validate Against Patterns**: Check against documented approaches
5. **Store New Insights**: Use `qdrant-store` to capture successful solutions
6. **Cross-Reference Solutions**: Link implementations to established practices

### **Quality-First Development (RAG-Augmented)**
1. **Use [Build System] for Everything**: [e.g., Never run tools directly, use make/npm scripts]
2. **Query Before Implementing**: `qdrant-find "similar patterns"` before coding

### **MANDATORY FILE CREATION PROTOCOLS**
**BEFORE ANY FILE WRITE OPERATION:**
1. **ALWAYS verify current working directory**: `pwd`
2. **ALWAYS confirm repository context**: Check if you're in correct project directory
3. **NEVER assume repository location from memory or conversation context**
4. **ALWAYS use relative paths within the target repository**

### **REPOSITORY SCOPE BOUNDARIES**
- **[Repository 1]**: [Purpose and scope]
- **[Repository 2]**: [Purpose and scope]
- **[Repository 3]**: [Purpose and scope]

### **FORBIDDEN CROSS-REPOSITORY OPERATIONS**

- ‚ùå Creating [repo B] files in [repo A] repository
- ‚ùå Using absolute paths when relative paths suffice
- ‚ùå Modifying files in one repository while working in another repository context
