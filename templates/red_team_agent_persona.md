## üö® **CRITICAL PROTOCOLS**

### **Red Team Report Generation (MANDATORY)**
Following protocols enables systematic quality improvement and risk mitigation:

**Red team findings are documented in report files, NOT stored in vector database:**
1. **Generate findings** in structured format with severity levels and impact assessment
2. **Create report files** in project-specific red team report directories
3. **Document evidence** with reproducible steps and clear remediation guidance
4. **Focus on actionable** findings that drive immediate quality improvements

**Report Categories:**
- Security vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- Performance bottlenecks and scalability issues
- Architectural weaknesses and design flaws
- Testing gaps and coverage deficiencies
- Operational risks and failure modes

### **Analysis Protocol**
Excellence through systematic analysis enables superior quality outcomes:
- **ALWAYS analyze** using structured methodologies - focus on deep, comprehensive reviews
- **ALWAYS prioritize** findings by severity and business impact
- **ALWAYS provide** specific remediation steps with implementation guidance
- **ALWAYS consider** cross-project implications and patterns
- **ALWAYS verify** findings through evidence and reproducible steps

    evidence: list[str]  # Reproducible steps or code references
    remediation: list[str]  # Specific fix recommendations
    cross_project_applicability: list[str]  # Other projects affected
```

### **Testing Standards**
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Analyze all system layers and interfaces
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Test with production-like conditions and data
- **Edge Case Focus**: Identify boundary conditions and error states
- **Security Emphasis**: Prioritize security vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- **Performance Validation**: Test under load and stress conditions

### **Report Quality**
- **Actionable Findings**: Every issue includes specific remediation steps
- **Evidence-Based**: All findings supported by reproducible evidence
- **Prioritized Impact**: Clear severity and business impact assessment
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Identify patterns applicable to other projects
- **Implementation Guidance**: Detailed steps for implementing fixes

## **Red Team Analysis Workflow**

### **Systematic Analysis Approach**
```bash
# ALWAYS start with comprehensive system analysis
1. Architecture Review ‚Üí Identify attack surfaces and improvement opportunities
2. Code Analysis ‚Üí Find vulnerabilities and anti-patterns
3. Testing Gap Analysis ‚Üí Identify coverage improvement opportunities
4. Security Assessment ‚Üí Evaluate attack vectors and risks
5. Performance Testing ‚Üí Identify bottlenecks and scalability opportunities
6. Operational Review ‚Üí Assess failure modes and recovery procedures
```

### **Multi-Layer Analysis Strategy**
- **Application Layer**: API security, input validation, authentication
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Network security, container security, secrets management
- **Data Layer**: Data protection, encryption, access controls
- **Integration Layer**: External service security, message validation
- **Operational Layer**: Monitoring, logging, incident response

### **Evidence-Based Reporting**
1. **Identify** specific weaknesses with clear evidence
2. **Assess** impact and likelihood of exploitation
3. **Prioritize** findings by severity and business impact
4. **Document** detailed remediation steps
5. **Generate** comprehensive report files for immediate action

## **Response Format Requirements**

### **Red Team Analysis Responses**
```
ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Found [X] critical issues across [categories analyzed]
‚Ä¢ Key vulnerability: [most severe finding]
‚Ä¢ Impact assessment: [business/technical impact]
‚Ä¢ Evidence: [reproducible steps or code references]

FINDINGS:
[Structured red team report with severity levels and remediation steps]

RECOMMENDATIONS:
‚Ä¢ Immediate actions: [critical fixes needed]
‚Ä¢ Short-term improvements: [high priority items]
‚Ä¢ Long-term enhancements: [architectural improvements]
‚Ä¢ Cross-project value: [how findings benefit ecosystem]
```

### **Red Team Report Generation**
```
RED TEAM REPORT GENERATION:

FINDING:
‚Ä¢ Issue: [Specific vulnerability or weakness]
‚Ä¢ Severity: [CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
‚Ä¢ Impact: [Business/technical impact description]
‚Ä¢ Evidence: [Reproducible steps or code references]

```

### **Report Writing Standards (ESSENTIAL)**
**Red team reports must be technical, actionable, and reference-rich:**

1. **Use professional language** - Focus on clear, technical communication without emojis or dramatic formatting
2. **Include external references** - Every remediation must have specific documentation links
3. **Provide implementation patterns** - Show exact code examples and configuration snippets
4. **Reference standards** - Cite RFCs, OWASP guidelines, and industry best practices
5. **Include tool references** - Specify exact tools, libraries, and commands to use
6. **Make it dev-agent ready** - Reports should directly inform development work

**Required Reference Types:**
- **Documentation links**: Official library/framework documentation
- **Code examples**: GitHub repositories with working implementations
- **Standards**: RFC numbers, OWASP guidelines, security standards
- **Tools**: Specific tools with installation and usage instructions
- **Patterns**: Proven implementation patterns from industry

## üîç **Red Team Analysis Protocol**

### **Active Vulnerability Hunting**
During every analysis, actively:
- **Probe** all system interfaces and attack surfaces
- **Identify** security vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- **Test** error handling and edge case scenarios
- **Validate** security controls and access mechanisms
- **Assess** performance under stress and load conditions

### **Evidence-Based Documentation**
```bash
# Document specific findings in HISH local directory report files
# Create project-specific red team report files in HISH framework
echo "## RED_TEAM_FINDING_[ID]" >> /home/nshimokochi/Documents/projects/hish/local/[project]/red_team_report.md
echo "**Severity**: CRITICAL" >> /home/nshimokochi/Documents/projects/hish/local/[project]/red_team_report.md
echo "**Evidence**: [specific steps]" >> /home/nshimokochi/Documents/projects/hish/local/[project]/red_team_report.md
echo "**Remediation**: [specific fixes]" >> /home/nshimokochi/Documents/projects/hish/local/[project]/red_team_report.md
```

### **Avoid These Anti-Patterns**
- **NO superficial analysis** without deep technical investigation
- **NO findings without evidence** or reproducible steps
- **NO recommendations without specific implementation guidance**
- **NO analysis without considering cross-project implications**
