# üü¢ [PROJECT NAME] DEV AGENT INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è
**üö® MANDATORY COMPLIANCE - ZERO TOLERANCE FOR VIOLATIONS üö®**
**‚õî FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROTOCOLS BREAKS PROJECT CONTINUITY ‚õî**

## Purpose
This file defines the MANDATORY initialization protocol for the [Project Name] Dev Agent. **STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED.**

---

## üîí **PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT NOTICE** üîí
**ALL agents MUST follow these protocols EXACTLY:**
- **Context/Persona Updates**: Follow timestamp verification and update protocols PRECISELY
- **No Assumptions**: Verify ALL information before making changes
- **Historical Preservation**: NEVER remove or overwrite existing data
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Use verified system timestamps ONLY - NO HALLUCINATIONS

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
- Breaks historical project continuity
- Corrupts development tracking
- Requires manual data recovery
- Compromises project integrity

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Required Reading and Absorption**
**üö® MANDATORY: You MUST read and fully understand ALL of the following files before starting ANY work:**

- **dev_agent_persona.md**: Contains the [Project Name] Dev Agent's role, coding standards, architectural philosophy, and **RAG-ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY**. This file defines *how* you should think, code, and communicate using knowledge discovery first.
- **dev_agent_context.md**: Contains the current project state, achievements, issues, architectural decisions, technical debt, and **CRITICAL UPDATE PROTOCOLS**. This file defines *what* is happening in the project, *why*, and *what to prioritize*. **‚ö†Ô∏è READ THE UPDATE PROTOCOL SECTION COMPLETELY BEFORE ANY EDITS ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- **workflows-and-processes/**: ALL files in this directory contain workflow documentation, process guidelines, and special project context. These provide critical operational knowledge and lessons learned.

**üõë FAILURE TO READ these files completely VIOLATES the initialization protocol üõë**

## üß† **RAG + MCP KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM**
**üöÄ ENHANCED CAPABILITIES: You now have access to dynamic knowledge across the entire [Project Name] ecosystem:**

### **Available RAG Tools**
- **`qdrant-find`**: Semantic search across all project repositories and documentation
- **`qdrant-store`**: Store successful patterns and solutions for future retrieval

### **Knowledge Collections**
- **`[project]_dev_assets`** ([X] chunks): Development workflows, processes, persona, context documentation
- **`[project]_code_repos`** ([Y] chunks): Actual implementation patterns, configurations, test examples
- **`[additional_collections]`** ([Z] chunks): [Description of additional knowledge sources]

### **Mandatory Usage Patterns**
- **Query First**: Use `qdrant-find` to discover existing patterns before reading files manually
- **Learn from History**: Search for similar implementations across all repositories
- **Store Solutions**: Use `qdrant-store` to capture successful patterns for future knowledge base
- **Avoid Pitfalls**: Query documented anti-patterns and known issues before implementing
