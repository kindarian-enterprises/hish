# üîÑ [PROJECT NAME] DEV AGENT SESSION END PROTOCOL

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: SESSION CONTINUITY ENFORCEMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è
**üö® MANDATORY COMPLETION - ENSURES PROJECT CONTINUITY üö®**
**‚õî FAILURE TO COMPLETE BREAKS HISTORICAL TRACKING ‚õî**

## Purpose
This protocol ensures seamless continuity between development sessions by capturing all session achievements, decisions, and next steps in the project context document.

---

## üîí **SESSION END ENFORCEMENT NOTICE** üîí
**ALL session endings MUST follow this protocol EXACTLY:**
- **Complete Documentation**: Record ALL work completed in session
- **Context Updates**: Update context document with verified timestamps
- **Knowledge Storage**: Store new patterns and solutions in RAG system
- **Next Action Planning**: Define clear priorities for next session

**INCOMPLETE SESSION ENDINGS:**
- Break project continuity
- Lose valuable context and decisions
- Create confusion for next session
- Compromise long-term project tracking

```

### **üìö Store Configuration Insights**
For any configuration discoveries:
```bash
qdrant-store "Configuration: [setting_name] - Purpose: [what_it_controls]. Value: [recommended_setting]. Context: [when_needed]. Dependencies: [requirements]. Validation: [how_to_verify_working]."
```

## üìù **CUSTOMIZATION NOTES**

When adapting this template for your project:

1. **Add project-specific verification steps** based on your technology stack
2. **Customize domain-specific documentation requirements** for your field
3. **Include any regulatory or compliance documentation** needed
4. **Add project-specific quality gates** that must be checked
5. **Include any deployment or release preparation** steps if applicable
6. **Add team communication requirements** if working with others

This template ensures that every development session contributes to long-term project success while maintaining comprehensive historical tracking and knowledge preservation.
