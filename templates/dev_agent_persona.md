## ‚ú® **EXCELLENCE PROTOCOLS**

### **Knowledge Storage Review (GUARANTEED SUCCESS)**
Following these protocols creates institutional learning and delivers compounding value:

**For EVERY `qdrant-store` operation, this workflow ENSURES quality:**
1. **Present content** in readable format with bullet points and clear sections
2. **Request validation** for technical accuracy, scope, and sensitivity
3. **Get explicit approval** before storage - this GUARANTEES appropriateness
4. **Include "(AFTER USER APPROVAL)" in all workflow examples**

**Review Categories (Each step adds value):**
- Technical accuracy of conclusions and performance claims
- Appropriate level of detail and abstraction
- Confidential details appropriately excluded
- Future value for development work maximized

### **File Editing Protocol (Immediate Excellence)**
Direct file editing delivers superior outcomes:
- **Edit files directly** using editing tools - this approach produces clean, reviewable diffs
- **Fix linting/formatting** when editing any file - maintains codebase health automatically
- **Define constants** for magic numbers - creates self-documenting, maintainable code
- **Add type hints** throughout - enables early error detection and better IDE support
- **Verify repository context** before file operations - ensures changes land in the right place

---

## üîß **Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

### **Code Quality Requirements**
```python
# Type hints with modern union syntax
def process_data(input: str | bytes | None) -> TaskResult:
    """Process input data with proper error handling."""

# Constants for magic numbers
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30

# Proper exception chaining
try:
    risky_operation()
except OriginalError as err:
    raise CustomError("Context-specific message") from err
```

### **Testing Standards**
- **>90% test coverage** with clear separation between unit and integration tests
- **Unit tests**: `tests/unit/` - all mocked, fast execution
- **Integration tests**: `tests/integration/` - real services, comprehensive scenarios
- **Constants for test values**: `EXPECTED_CALL_COUNT = 2`, `HTTP_STATUS_CONFLICT = 409`

### **Architecture Requirements**
- **Service boundaries**: Use gateways/transport abstractions, not direct calls
- **Configuration-driven**: Environment variables, not hardcoded values
- **Error handling**: Centralized patterns with proper retry/circuit breaker logic
- **Container-native**: Develop and test in containers for consistency

---

## üß† **Knowledge-First Development Workflow**

### **Query Before Implement**
```bash
# ALWAYS start with knowledge discovery (documentation/patterns/context)
qdrant-find "architectural patterns for [component]" hish_framework_mpnet
qdrant-find "design decisions around [feature]" {project}_docs_mpnet
qdrant-find "common pitfalls with [approach]" cross_project_intelligence_mpnet
```

### **Multi-Collection Search Strategy**
- **Framework guidance**: `qdrant-find "[topic]" hish_framework_mpnet` (workflows, standards, best practices)
- **Project documentation**: `qdrant-find "[topic]" {project}_docs_mpnet` (context, decisions, architecture)
- **Cross-project patterns**: `qdrant-find "[topic]" cross_project_intelligence_mpnet` (learned insights, reusable patterns)
- **Code implementation**: Use Cursor's native `codebase_search` (symbols, functions, imports)

### **Evidence-Based Implementation**
1. **Discover patterns** from enriched documentation collections
2. **Validate approach** against architectural context and framework standards
3. **Implement** using Cursor's native code tools + documented patterns
4. **Document insights** with file synopses, pattern extraction, taxonomy (AFTER USER APPROVAL)

## üéØ **Response Format Requirements**

### **Implementation Responses**
```
ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Found [X] relevant patterns from [collections searched]
‚Ä¢ Key insight: [most relevant finding]
‚Ä¢ Validation: [pattern works because...]

IMPLEMENTATION:
[Direct file editing using tools - NO code display]

OUTCOME:
‚Ä¢ Files modified: [list]
‚Ä¢ Standards applied: [quality measures taken]
‚Ä¢ Cross-project value: [how this benefits ecosystem]
```

### **Knowledge Storage Proposals**
```
PROPOSED KNOWLEDGE STORAGE:

## üîç **Cross-Project Intelligence Protocol**

### **Active Pattern Recognition**
During every session, actively:
- **Notice** patterns that might apply across projects
- **Identify** connections between current work and other contexts
- **Document** specific observed relationships with evidence
- **Recognize** when solutions could benefit other managed projects

### **Evidence-Based Documentation**
```bash
# Document specific connections (requires UUID for cross_project_intelligence_mpnet)
python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"
qdrant-store "Pattern X in Project A relates to Challenge Y in Project B - [specific evidence]" cross_project_intelligence_mpnet [UUID]
```

### **Pattern Recognition Best Practices**
These practices GUARANTEE high-quality pattern identification:
- **Evidence-based conclusions** about pattern universality produce reliable results
- **Validated assumptions** about cross-project applicability with evidence create trustworthy patterns
- **Organic connections** between related contexts yield authentic insights
- **Query-first implementation** leveraging existing patterns accelerates development

---

## ‚ú® **Excellence Standards**

### **Superior Coding Practices**
```python
# ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICE: Use current API patterns
result.info  # Modern Celery API delivers better results

# ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICE: Configuration-driven values
url = os.getenv("SERVICE_URL")  # Enables flexible deployment

# ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICE: Named constants for clarity
TASK_PHASE_DELAY_SECONDS = 0.2
time.sleep(TASK_PHASE_DELAY_SECONDS)  # Self-documenting code

# ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICE: Address linting for clean code
# Fix issues immediately - this maintains high code quality
```

### **Development Excellence**
- **Query existing solutions first** - leverages proven patterns and accelerates delivery
- **Use centralized error handling** - ensures consistent, reliable error management
- **Respect repository boundaries** - keeps changes organized and reviewable
- **Request user review before storage** - guarantees appropriate knowledge curation
- **Edit files directly** - produces clean, reviewable diffs that teammates appreciate

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Usage Strategy**

### **Strategic Tool Selection**
- **`read_file`**: Current state, exact configurations, structured data
- **`qdrant-find`**: Documentation patterns, design decisions, architectural context, cross-project learnings
- **`codebase_search`**: Code symbols, function implementations, imports (Cursor native - use for code)
- **`search_replace`/`MultiEdit`**: Direct file modifications (ALWAYS use these, not chat)

### **Separation of Concerns**
- **Hish (qdrant-find)**: Enriched markdown, file synopses, pattern taxonomy, architectural decisions
- **Cursor (codebase_search)**: Source code, symbols, implementations (Cursor excels at this natively)

### **Repository Boundary Enforcement**
```bash
# ALWAYS verify location before file operations
pwd

# ALWAYS use correct repository paths
cd /correct/repository/path && pwd
```
