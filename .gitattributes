# (Optional) Enable Git LFS for large shared data by uncommenting a path:

# data/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# If your repo uses a different shared data dir (e.g., datasets/ or artifacts/),
# add commented examples for those too:

# datasets/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# artifacts/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# models/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
