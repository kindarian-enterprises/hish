# üîÑ **HISH AGENT SESSION END PROTOCOL**

## üéØ Purpose
Capture session achievements, decisions, and learnings to ensure seamless continuity between development sessions and maximize cross-project knowledge transfer.

## üìã Session Completion Checklist
- **Document work completed** with specific outcomes and files modified
- **Update context documents** with verified timestamps and accurate status
- **Store new patterns** in knowledge base for ecosystem benefit (with user approval)
- **Plan next session** with clear priorities and actionable steps
- **Identify cross-project value** from session work and decisions

---

## üìù **Session Documentation**

### **Work Summary**
- [ ] Features implemented or bugs fixed
- [ ] Files created, modified, or deleted
- [ ] Architectural decisions made
- [ ] Configuration changes
- [ ] Test coverage updates
- [ ] Cross-project patterns discovered

### **Context Updates**

**Generate verified timestamp:**
```bash
date -u  # Use actual system output
```

**Choose correct context file:**
- `local/dev_agent_framework_context.md` - framework enhancements
- `local/[project-name]/dev_agent_context.md` - project-specific work

**Update format:**
```markdown
achievement_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS_description {
  verified_datetime: [system_output];
  achievement: [specific_outcome];
  impact: [measurable_effect];
  files: [modified_files];
  cross_project_applicability: [ecosystem_benefits]
}
```

## üß† **Knowledge Capture**

### **Pattern Storage (AFTER USER APPROVAL)**
Present to user for review before storage:
```
PROPOSED KNOWLEDGE STORAGE:

SOLUTION: [Pattern name and description]
CONTEXT: [When/where applicable]
IMPLEMENTATION: [Technical approach]
PERFORMANCE: [Measured outcomes]
FILES: [Code locations]
CROSS-PROJECT VALUE: [How this benefits ecosystem]

Please review for technical accuracy and scope appropriateness.
```

### **Storage Commands (Unified MPNet Collections)**
```bash
# Generate UUID for cross_project_intelligence collection
python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"

# Store with user approval (unified MPNet embeddings)
qdrant-store "Solution: [description] - Context: [conditions] - Performance: [metrics] - Files: [locations]" cross_project_intelligence_mpnet [UUID]
```

---

## üîó **Cross-Project Intelligence**

### **Pattern Recognition**
- [ ] Which patterns from other projects were applied?
- [ ] What new patterns emerged with potential ecosystem value?
- [ ] What anti-patterns were discovered or avoided?
- [ ] Which solutions might benefit other projects?

### **Relationship Documentation**
- [ ] **Similarities**: "Approach X resembles Pattern Y from Project Z in these ways: [specific connections]"
- [ ] **Applications**: "This solution might apply to Project H because both involve [shared requirements]"
- [ ] **Learning Transfers**: "Project I could benefit from [specific aspect], pending validation"

### **Performance Metrics**
- [ ] **Outcomes**: Solution achieved [metrics] under [conditions]
- [ ] **Constraints**: Approach worked within [limitations]
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Success required [specific conditions]

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **NEXT SESSION PLANNING**

### **üéØ Immediate Priorities**
- [ ] Define next session's primary objectives
- [ ] Identify any blocking issues or dependencies
- [ ] Plan cross-project research needs
- [ ] Schedule knowledge sharing activities

### **üìö Knowledge Requirements**
- [ ] What patterns should be researched before next session?
- [ ] What cross-project solutions should be investigated?
- [ ] What documentation needs to be reviewed?
- [ ] What tools or approaches should be validated?

### **üéØ Methodology Evolution**
- [ ] **Store development insights to hish_framework_mpnet collection**:
  ```bash
  # Example: Store discovered methodology improvements (unified MPNet embeddings)
  qdrant-store "Development Insight: [Approach] proved effective for [Context] - [Specific benefits and evidence]. Framework Evolution: [How this could improve agent guidance]." hish_framework_mpnet
  ```

### **üîÑ Continuity Preparation**
- [ ] Ensure all context updates are complete
- [ ] Verify knowledge storage was successful
- [ ] Prepare clear handoff information
- [ ] Document any assumptions or context for next session

---
