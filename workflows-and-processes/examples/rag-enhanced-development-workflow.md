# RAG-Enhanced Development Workflow Example

## 🎯 **WORKFLOW PURPOSE**
This workflow demonstrates how to leverage RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) + MCP (Model Context Protocol) for knowledge-driven development across your project ecosystem.

## 🧠 **KNOWLEDGE-FIRST DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**

### **Phase 1: Discovery & Context Building**
```bash
# STEP 1: Query for similar implementations
qdrant-find "authentication implementation patterns"
qdrant-find "error handling approaches for API services"
qdrant-find "configuration management examples"

# STEP 2: Query for anti-patterns and known issues
qdrant-find "known pitfalls with JWT authentication"
qdrant-find "common API security mistakes"
qdrant-find "configuration management anti-patterns"

# STEP 3: Cross-repository pattern discovery
qdrant-find "similar features in other projects"
qdrant-find "testing strategies for this component type"
```

### **Phase 2: Implementation with Knowledge Validation**
```bash
# STEP 1: Validate approach against existing patterns
qdrant-find "successful implementations of similar authentication"

# STEP 2: Check for architectural consistency
qdrant-find "design decisions for security components"

# STEP 3: Review error handling patterns
qdrant-find "error handling patterns for web services"
```

### **Phase 3: Knowledge Capture & Storage**
```bash
# STEP 1: Store successful implementation patterns
qdrant-store "Authentication Solution: JWT with refresh tokens - Implemented secure token management with automatic refresh. Context: Web API authentication. Validates against: OWASP guidelines. Files: auth.py, middleware.py. Performance: 50ms avg response time."

# STEP 2: Store anti-patterns discovered
qdrant-store "Anti-pattern: Storing JWT secrets in code - Failed because secrets exposed in repository. Alternative: Environment variables with rotation. Context: Any JWT implementation. Prevention: Use secret management service."

# STEP 3: Store configuration insights
qdrant-store "Configuration: JWT expiration times - Access tokens: 15min, Refresh: 7 days. Context: Balance security vs UX. Dependencies: Redis for token blacklisting. Validated in: Production load testing."
```

## 🔍 **ERROR RESOLUTION WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Historical Context Query**
```bash
# Query for similar error patterns
qdrant-find "authentication token validation errors"
qdrant-find "middleware configuration issues"
qdrant-find "database connection failures"
```

### **Step 2: Solution Pattern Discovery**
```bash
# Find documented solutions
qdrant-find "fixes for token expiration handling"
qdrant-find "middleware error recovery patterns"
qdrant-find "database retry strategies"
```

### **Step 3: Implementation & Validation**
```bash
# Apply solution with knowledge context
# Test against documented patterns
# Validate across affected services
```

### **Step 4: Solution Documentation**
```bash
# Store the successful resolution
qdrant-store "Error Resolution: JWT validation 401 errors - Root cause: Clock skew between services. Solution: Added 30s leeway to token validation. Validation: Zero 401 errors in 24h monitoring. Context: Distributed services with time sync issues."
```

## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE DECISION WORKFLOW**

### **Research Phase**
```bash
# Query existing architectural decisions
qdrant-find "authentication architecture decisions"
qdrant-find "microservice communication patterns"
qdrant-find "data storage design decisions"
```

### **Decision Validation**
```bash
# Check consistency with existing patterns
qdrant-find "similar architectural choices and outcomes"
qdrant-find "integration patterns with existing components"
qdrant-find "scalability considerations for this approach"
```

### **Documentation & Storage**
```bash
# Store architectural decision with full context
qdrant-store "Architecture Decision: OAuth2 + JWT for API auth - Rationale: Standard compliance, scalability, stateless design. Alternatives: Session-based (rejected: not scalable), API keys (rejected: limited features). Implementation: OAuth2 server + JWT middleware. Impact: All API endpoints, mobile app integration. Trade-offs: Complexity vs security."
```

## 🧪 **TESTING STRATEGY WITH RAG**

### **Test Pattern Discovery**
```bash
# Find existing test patterns
qdrant-find "authentication testing strategies"
qdrant-find "API integration testing patterns"
qdrant-find "security testing approaches"
```

### **Test Implementation**
```bash
# Apply discovered patterns with adaptations
# Validate test coverage against similar components
# Check for test anti-patterns
```

### **Test Knowledge Storage**
```bash
# Store effective testing patterns
qdrant-store "Test Pattern: JWT authentication testing - Approach: Mock time for expiration tests, test token malformation, verify security headers. Validates: Authentication flow, error handling, security compliance. Setup: Test database, mock OAuth server. Edge cases: Expired tokens, malformed tokens, missing tokens."
```

## 🔧 **CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT WITH RAG**

### **Configuration Discovery**
```bash
# Find configuration patterns
qdrant-find "environment configuration for authentication services"
qdrant-find "secrets management approaches"
qdrant-find "database configuration patterns"
```

### **Configuration Validation**
```bash
# Validate against existing patterns
qdrant-find "working authentication configurations"
qdrant-find "production configuration examples"
```

### **Configuration Documentation**
```bash
# Store configuration insights
qdrant-store "Configuration: OAuth2 provider settings - Purpose: External authentication integration. Settings: client_id via env, client_secret via vault, redirect_uri whitelist. Environment: Production requires HTTPS. Validation: Health check endpoint returns provider status."
```

## 📊 **PERFORMANCE PATTERNS WITH RAG**

### **Performance Query Patterns**
```bash
# Find performance-related patterns
qdrant-find "authentication performance optimization"
qdrant-find "API response time improvements"
qdrant-find "caching strategies for auth tokens"
```

### **Performance Analysis**
```bash
# Apply known optimization patterns
# Validate against documented approaches
# Check for performance anti-patterns
```

### **Performance Knowledge Storage**
```bash
# Store performance insights
qdrant-store "Performance Pattern: JWT token caching - Optimization: Cache validated tokens for 5min to reduce DB calls. Impact: 80% reduction in auth latency (200ms -> 40ms). Metrics: 95th percentile response time. Context: High-frequency API calls. Trade-offs: Memory usage vs database load."
```

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW WITH RAG**

### **Deployment Pattern Discovery**
```bash
# Find deployment patterns
qdrant-find "authentication service deployment strategies"
qdrant-find "secret management in production"
qdrant-find "zero-downtime deployment patterns"
```

### **Deployment Validation**
```bash
# Validate against existing deployment patterns
# Check for deployment anti-patterns
# Verify against documented approaches
```

### **Deployment Documentation**
```bash
# Store deployment insights
qdrant-store "Deployment Pattern: Blue-green auth service deployment - Process: Deploy to green, validate health checks, switch traffic, monitor error rates. Requirements: Load balancer, health endpoints, monitoring. Validation: Zero auth errors during switch. Rollback: Traffic switch takes 30 seconds."
```

## 🎯 **WORKFLOW SUCCESS METRICS**

- **Query Efficiency**: Time from problem identification to solution discovery
- **Pattern Reuse**: Frequency of applying stored patterns to new problems
- **Error Reduction**: Decrease in repeated mistakes through anti-pattern queries
- **Cross-Repository Value**: Solutions found in other projects applied successfully
- **Knowledge Growth**: Rate of new pattern storage and validation

This workflow transforms development from reactive problem-solving to proactive, knowledge-driven engineering.
