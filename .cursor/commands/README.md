# üéØ HISH Cursor Custom Commands

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** October 17, 2025
**Compatibility:** Cursor IDE with custom slash commands support

---

## üìã Overview

HISH Custom Commands provide instant access to agent initialization and session management through Cursor's native `/` command system. Commands are **globally installed** and available in all Cursor projects - installed once via `make setup-cursor`.

### ‚ú® Key Benefits

- **Native Integration** - Uses Cursor's built-in `/` command system
- **Global Availability** - Commands work in all Cursor projects, not just HISH folder
- **Automatic Installation** - Installed via `make setup-cursor` with absolute paths
- **Version Controlled** - Source commands are git-tracked and team-shared
- **Instant Access** - Type `/` in chat to see all HISH commands

---

## üöÄ Quick Reference

### Available Commands

| Command | Description | References |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `/dev` | Initialize development agent | `@prompts/dev_agent/dev_agent_init_prompt.md` |
| `/red` | Initialize red team agent | `@prompts/red_team/red_team_agent_init_prompt.md` |
| `/end-dev` | Close dev session properly | `@prompts/dev_agent/dev_agent_session_end_prompt.md` |
| `/end-red` | Close red team session | `@prompts/red_team/red_team_agent_session_end_prompt.md` |

---

## üí° Usage

### How to Use Commands

**Step 1: Ensure commands are installed**
```bash
cd /path/to/hish
make setup-cursor  # Installs commands globally
```

**Step 2: Open any project in Cursor**
```bash
cd /path/to/any/project
cursor .
```

**Step 3: Open chat panel**
- Click the chat icon in Cursor's sidebar
- Or press the chat keyboard shortcut

**Step 4: Type `/` to see commands**
```
Type: /
```

You'll see a dropdown menu showing:
```
/dev - Initialize Dev Agent
/red - Initialize Red Team Agent
/end-dev - End Dev Session
/end-red - End Red Team Session
```

**Step 5: Select or type command name**
```
Type: /dev
Press: Enter
```

The command expands to reference the agent initialization prompt:
```
@prompts/dev_agent/dev_agent_init_prompt.md
```

**Step 6: Agent processes the prompt**
- Command references HISH prompt using absolute path
- HISH hooks inject collection guidance automatically
- Agent loads full context and framework knowledge
- Agent is ready for development work

**Note:** Commands work from **any project** - you don't need to have HISH folder open!

## üé® Usage Examples

### Example 1: Starting a Development Session

**Before (Manual):**
```
Type: @prompts/dev_agent/dev_agent_init_prompt.md
```

**After (Custom Command):**
```
Type: /dev [Enter]
```

**Result:** Same outcome, 75% less typing.

---

### Example 2: Proper Session Closure

**Before (Manual):**
```
Type: @prompts/dev_agent/dev_agent_session_end_prompt.md
```

**After (Custom Command):**
```
Type: /end-dev [Enter]
```

**Result:** Agent follows complete session end protocol with context updates and knowledge capture.

---

### Example 3: Quick Agent Switching

**Scenario:** You finish development work and need to run security analysis (works from any project!).

```
1. Type: /end-dev [Enter]
   ‚Üí Closes dev session, saves context

2. Type: /red [Enter]
   ‚Üí Initializes red team agent

3. Agent ready for security analysis
```

**Result:** Seamless transition between agent modes with proper session management. Works in any Cursor project!

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Global Command Installation

HISH commands are installed to Cursor's standard commands directory:

1. **Installation Script**: `make setup-cursor` runs `scripts/setup-commands.sh`
2. **Path Substitution**: `{{HISH_ROOT}}` replaced with absolute HISH path
3. **Standard Directory**: Commands copied to `~/.cursor/commands/` (all platforms)
4. **Cursor Detection**: Cursor automatically loads commands from `~/.cursor/commands/`
5. **Reference Resolution**: When triggered, `@` references use absolute paths to HISH prompts

### Installation Path

Commands are installed to the standard `~/.cursor/commands/` directory on all platforms (per [Cursor documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/chat/custom-commands)).

### Command File Structure

**Source files** (in HISH repo) use placeholder syntax:

```markdown
---
name: Display Name
description: Description shown in autocomplete
---

# Optional Title

@{{HISH_ROOT}}/prompts/path/to/prompt.md

[Optional additional context]
```

**Installed files** (after `make setup-cursor`) have absolute paths:

```markdown
---
name: Display Name
description: Description shown in autocomplete
---

# Optional Title

@/absolute/path/to/hish/prompts/path/to/prompt.md

[Optional additional context]
```

**Key Points:**
- `{{HISH_ROOT}}` placeholder is replaced during installation
- Installed commands use absolute paths to work from any project
- Frontmatter (`name`, `description`) defines `/` menu appearance
- `@` syntax references existing HISH prompt files

### Integration with HISH Architecture

```
User Types /dev
     ‚Üì
Cursor expands to: @prompts/dev_agent/dev_agent_init_prompt.md
     ‚Üì
[beforeSubmitPrompt Hook] - Injects collection guidance
     ‚Üì
Agent receives full initialization prompt + HISH context
     ‚Üì
Agent activates with cross-project intelligence
```

**No changes needed to:**
- Existing prompt files (commands just reference them)
- HISH hooks (work transparently)
- MCP server (unaffected)
- Makefile (no installation needed)

## üìù Adding New Commands

Want to add more custom commands? It's easy!

### Step 1: Create Command File

```bash
touch .cursor/commands/my-command.md
```

### Step 2: Add Frontmatter and Content

```markdown
---
name: My Custom Command
description: What this command does
---

# My Command Title

@path/to/existing/prompt.md

Optional context or reminders.
```

### Step 3: Save and Test

1. Save the file
2. Type `/` in Cursor chat
3. Your command appears in the dropdown
4. Select it to test

**That's it!** No restart, no installation, just works.

### Naming Conventions

**Command Files:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `my-command.md`
- Keep names short and descriptive
- Avoid conflicts with Cursor's built-in commands

**Command Names (in frontmatter):**
- Use title case: "My Custom Command"
- Be descriptive but concise
- Match HISH terminology

**Descriptions:**
- One clear sentence
- Explain what happens when triggered
- Use active voice

## üîÑ Updating Commands

### For Users

**Getting Updates:**
```bash
cd /path/to/hish
git pull
make setup-cursor  # Or: make setup-commands
```

This reinstalls commands with latest changes. Restart Cursor to see updated commands.

### For Maintainers

**Updating Command Files:**
1. Edit `.cursor/commands/*.md` files
2. Test changes in Cursor
3. Commit to git
4. Users get updates via `git pull`

**Best Practices:**
- Keep commands simple (just reference existing prompts)
- Don't duplicate content from prompt files
- Test commands before committing
- Update this README if adding new commands

---

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Simplicity First

Commands are **wrappers**, not replacements:
- Reference existing prompt files with `@` syntax
- Don't duplicate prompt content
- Keep command files minimal (< 20 lines)
- Single source of truth for prompts

### Discoverability

Commands should be **easy to find and understand**:
- Clear, descriptive names
- Helpful descriptions in autocomplete
- Consistent naming patterns
- Logical organization

### Maintainability

Commands are **easy to update and extend**:
- Version controlled in git
- Simple markdown format
- No complex logic or scripts
- Team-wide consistency

---

## üÜö Commands vs Other Approaches

### Why Custom Commands?

**vs Manual `@` references:**
- ‚úÖ Shorter typing (`/dev` vs `@prompts/dev_agent/dev_agent_init_prompt.md`)
- ‚úÖ Discoverable via `/` autocomplete
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming across team
- ‚úÖ Descriptions explain purpose

**vs Snippets:**
- ‚úÖ Native Cursor feature (no external tool)
- ‚úÖ Works only in chat (safer, more focused)
- ‚úÖ No installation scripts needed
- ‚úÖ Auto-detected from project directory

**vs Cursor Rules:**
- ‚úÖ Explicit invocation (on-demand, not automatic)
- ‚úÖ Simpler implementation (just markdown)
- ‚úÖ Easier to understand for team members
- ‚úÖ Perfect for session lifecycle events

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Appearing in `/` Menu

**Problem:** Type `/` but don't see HISH commands.

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify commands are installed:**
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.cursor/commands/
   # Should see: dev.md, red.md, end-dev.md, end-red.md
   ```

2. **Reinstall commands:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/hish
   make setup-commands
   ```

3. **Check installed file has absolute path:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.cursor/commands/dev.md
   # Should show: @/absolute/path/to/hish/prompts/...
   ```

4. **Restart Cursor** to reload commands

### Command Doesn't Expand Correctly

**Problem:** Command runs but doesn't reference the prompt.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check `@` reference path:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.cursor/commands/dev.md
   # Should show: @/absolute/path/to/hish/prompts/dev_agent/dev_agent_init_prompt.md
   ```

2. **Verify prompt file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /path/to/hish/prompts/dev_agent/dev_agent_init_prompt.md
   ```

3. **Check for typos in file paths**

### Command Triggers Wrong Content

**Problem:** `/dev` triggers something unexpected.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check for command name conflicts:**
   - Type `/` and see if multiple commands have similar names
   - Rename your command to be more specific

2. **Verify frontmatter name field:**
   ```bash
   grep "^name:" .cursor/commands/dev.md
   ```

## üìä Command Usage Patterns

### Typical Development Workflow

```
Morning Session:
1. /dev                     # Initialize agent
2. [Development work]
3. /end-dev                 # Close session

Security Review:
1. /red                     # Initialize red team
2. [Security analysis]
3. /end-red                 # Document findings

Context Switch:
1. /end-dev                 # Close current agent
2. /red                     # Switch to different agent
3. [New work]
4. /end-red                 # Close when done
```

### Performance Metrics

Based on typical usage:

| Operation | Manual | Command | Time Saved |
|-----------|--------|---------|------------|
| Dev agent init | ~12 sec | ~2 sec | **83%** |
| Red team init | ~12 sec | ~2 sec | **83%** |
| Session close | ~12 sec | ~2 sec | **83%** |

**Average time savings: ~10 seconds per operation**

With 10 sessions per day: **100 seconds saved daily = 7 minutes per week**

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Do I need to install anything?

**A:** No! Commands auto-detect when you open the HISH folder in Cursor. Just `git pull` to get updates.

### Q: Can I create my own commands?

**A:** Yes! Create a `.md` file in `.cursor/commands/` with proper frontmatter. See "Adding New Commands" section.

### Q: Do commands work outside HISH folder?

**A:** Yes! Commands are **globally installed** and work in any Cursor project. This is the key benefit over project-scoped commands.

### Q: What if I typo a command name?

**A:** Use the `/` autocomplete menu - it shows all commands with descriptions. No need to memorize exact names.

### Q: Can I use commands in the editor?

**A:** No. Custom commands work only in Cursor's chat panel (which is the right place for agent session management).

### Q: How do I remove a command?

**A:** Delete the `.md` file from `.cursor/commands/`. Command disappears from `/` menu immediately.

### Q: Do commands interfere with HISH hooks?

**A:** No. Commands and hooks work together seamlessly. Commands provide UI convenience, hooks provide runtime behavior.
